Make sure you understand our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before doing any work.

## Generate docs

First run `npm install`, to inastall all dependencies, then run `npm run start:docs`, then the docs from this project will be generated and a server on port 8080 will be started, so go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the docs. When you open the docs, it's important to `disable the cache` to a better experience, otherwise it will have a delay every time you update the docs.
