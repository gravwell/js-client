## Contributing

Make sure you understand our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before doing any work.

## Generating docs

1. First run `npm clean-install`, to install all dependencies;
2. Then run `npm run start:docs`;
3. Then the docs from this project will be generated and served on port 8080;
4. Go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the docs.

> TIP: For a better experience, disable the Browser cache using the network developer tools. Otherwise it will have a delay every time you update the docs.
