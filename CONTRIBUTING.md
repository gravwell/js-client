# Contributing to the codebase

test

Before starting any work, make sure there's a github issue describing what will be done (if there's none, create one). In that issue, assign yourself as the responsible and tag it with `"In progress"`.

With an existing issue associated with your work, create a branch for your work using the following convention:

- `hotfix/{issue}` for hotfixes
- `fix/{issue}` for fixes
- `feature/{issue}` for features

Other branch conventions are:

- `dev` for the latest development version
- `master` for the latest general released version

Once your work is done and [conforms with our style conventions](#style-conventions):

1. Create a pull request (PR)
2. Link the issue
3. Tag the issue with `"To verify"`
4. Untag the issue with `"In progress"`
5. Assign yourself as the responsible for the PR
6. Assign at least one developer to review you work
7. Once all reviewers approve it, it can be merged by anyone with access.

## Commands

- `npm ci` for a clean install.
- `npm test` to execute the tests.
- `npm run build` to build the project for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
- `npm run lint` to lint the codebase with Prettier and ESLint.
- `npm run format` to automatically apply some style conventions.

## Style conventions

Before pushing (and preferably commiting too) any code, make sure it conforms to our conventions described below:

- ðŸš« Not verified by `npm run lint`, needs to be manually checked
- âœ… Verified by `npm run lint`, needs to be manually fixed
- ðŸš€ Verified by `npm run lint`, automatically fixed by `npm run format`

> NOTE: We have git hooks to check for some of those rules pre commit and pre push. You can bypass the pre commit hook with `--no-verify` if necessary, but **never** bypass it when pushing.

### ðŸš€ Semicolon, always

Always put semicolons after each statement.

### ðŸš€ Quotes, prefer single

Use single quotes unless the string contains a single quote, in that case use double quotes.

Do:

- `"It's my birthday"`
- `'It is my birthday'`

Don't :

- `"It is my birthday"`
- `'It\'s my birthday'`

### ðŸš€ Trailing comma, multiple lines

Add a trailing comma wherever possible when the list spams through multiple lines.

This rule clarifies our `git diff`s. If you were to add an element to a list with one element per line, you would have a diff showing the element you've added and the comma you had to put in the line above it. Using this rule, we won't have that problem.

Do:

<ul>
<li><code>[1, 2, 3];</code></li>
<li><pre>[
  longVariable,
  anotherLongVariable,
  yetAnotherLongVariable,
  theListWillCollapseSoon,
  itsTooLongToBeInASingleLine,
  addATrailingCommaNow,
];</pre></li>
</ul>

Don't:

<ul>
<li><code>[1, 2, 3,];</code></li>
<li><pre>[
  longVariable,
  anotherLongVariable,
  yetAnotherLongVariable,
  theListWillCollapseSoon,
  itsTooLongToBeInASingleLine,
  addATrailingCommaNow
];</pre></li>
</ul>

### ðŸš€ Bracket spacing, always

Add spaces between brackets.

Do:

- `const { a, b } = foo;`
- `import { x } from 'y';`

Don't:

- `const {a,b} = foo;`
- `import {x} from 'y';`

### ðŸš€ Arrow function parenthesis, avoid

Avoid adding parenthesis to arrow functions when there's only one parameter and it's type is inferred.

Do:

- `(a, b) => a + b;`
- `a => a + 1;`
- `(a: Date) => a.getTime();`

Don't:

- `(a) => a + 1;`

### ðŸš€ Indentation, tabs

Use tabs for indentation.

### ðŸš€ Max width, 120

Wherever possible, collapse lines longer than 120 characters.

### ðŸš€ Array types, generic

Describe array types using `Array<T>` instead of `T[]`.

### ðŸš€ Comment padding, 1 space

Comments must start with a space.

Do:

- `// NOTE: Blah blah blah`
- `// Foo bar baz`

Don't:

- `//NOTE: Blah blah blah`
- `//Foo bar baz`

### ðŸš€ Member access, always explicit

Always declare the property/method access level.

Do:

- `public property: string`
- `private _property: string`
- `public get property(): string`

Don't:

- `property: string`
- `get property(): string`

### ðŸš€ Member ordering, fields -> constructor -> methods

Sort your class members in the following order:

1. Static fields
2. Instance fields
3. Constructor
4. Static methods
5. Instance methods

### âœ… Variables, prefer const

Prefer `const`, avoid `let` and never use `var`.

### âœ… Equality, triple equals

Always use `===` and `!==` for equality checks. Never use `==` or `!=`.

### âœ… All caps, only const

Only allow `const` declarations to be ALL_CAPS.

Do:

- `const SOME_FIXED_VALUE = 123;`
- `let someChangingValue = 123;`

Don't:

- `let SOME_CHANGING_VALUE = 123;`

### ðŸš« File names, kebab case

All lowercase, use `-` for spaces and follow Angular conventions for dot separations.

Do:

- `app-routing.module.ts`
- `some-file.ts`
- `some-test.spec.ts`

Don't:

- `AppRouting.module.ts`
- `someFile.ts`
- `some-test.Spec.ts`

Exceptions:

- `Dockerfile`
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

### ðŸš« Styling preprocessor, SCSS

Always use `.scss` for style files.
